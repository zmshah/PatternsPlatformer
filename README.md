# PatternsPlatformer
CIS 514 (Advanced object oriented programming with design patterns) Final project. 2D platformer game using design patterns in a team of 3.
<br/> The game is built as a basic 2D Platformer with a character controlled by the player that can shoot/jump on enemies and collect coins for points. It is built in Unity using C# scripting language.
<br/> My main contributions included the movement and behavior of enemies using design patterns. Observer pattern is used for triggering events on enemies being destroyed. Builder pattern is used to create individual components of enemy objects.
Proxy pattern is used to decouple position algorithms from implementation. Prototype pattern is used to clone and spawn enemy objects. Strategy pattern is used to make the enemy objects move.
Iterator pattern is used to create arrays to store enemy objects. Singleton pattern to keep track of scoreboard from destroying enemies and collecting coins.
